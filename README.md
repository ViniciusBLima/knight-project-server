# Knight-Project

## Overview

The Knight Registry Management System is a web application designed to organize and manage a registry of knights. Built with MongoDB and Express.js, it allows users to create, view, modify, and delete entries of knights. Additional functionalities include filtering knights and highlighting those who have been designated as heroes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and MongoDB from [MongoDB's official site](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. **Install dependencies**

   Navigate to the root of your project directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Environment setup**

    Ensure that the .env file exists in your project directory and is configured correctly with the necessary environment variables, including MongoDB connection settings.
3.**Starting the application**

    Change to the src directory within your project folder:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
    Then, start the application by running:
    ```bash
    node app
    ```
This will launch the Knight-project on your local machine, and you should be able to access it, interacting with the database to manage the knight registry effectively
